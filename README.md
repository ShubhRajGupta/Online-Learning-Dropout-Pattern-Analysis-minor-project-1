## Online Learning Dropout Pattern Analysis {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### Overview

This project is about understanding how students drop out from online courses.  
In many online platforms, a lot of students join courses but many do not complete them.  
The goal is not prediction or advanced AI, but simple statistics and visualization.

### Objectives

- Divide students into early, mid, and late dropouts  
- Compare engagement levels between groups  
- Analyze relationship between activity and dropout timing  

### Dataset

A synthetic dataset was used due to privacy and availability constraints.

The dataset includes:
- Course duration  
- Last active day  
- Number of assignments submitted  
- Total video watch time  
- Average quiz score  

### Tools

Google Colab, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Gradio

### Visualizations

- Bar plots for dropout count  
- Box plots for engagement comparison  
- Violin plots for distribution  
- Scatter plots for engagement vs dropout  
- Correlation heatmap  

### Results & Observations

- Many students drop out early  
- Higher engagement correlates with course completion  
- Quiz score alone is not a strong indicator  
- Engagement matters more than performance  

### UI (Gradio)

A simple interactive UI allows:
- Selecting dropout phase  
- Choosing plot types  
- Viewing sample data
